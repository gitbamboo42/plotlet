# CLAUDE.md

Project memory for **plotlet** — a Python library for SVG plots, with multi-panel composition and an extension API for custom plot types.

This file gives Claude (or any collaborator) the context needed to be useful from the first message of a new session. Read it before suggesting changes.

## What this project is

plotlet is a Python library that produces matplotlib-flavored SVG plots. The architecture is a deferred-rendering pipeline: artist methods record into a list, then `show()` walks the list and emits one self-contained SVG string. Output is rendered by the consumer's browser/viewer; plotlet has no rendering engine of its own.

Product positioning — "scaffold, not catalog", why-not-matplotlib, custom plots in user projects — lives in [README.md](README.md) and [docs/PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md). This file focuses on *how plotlet is built and changed*.

## Core design principles

1. **Few lines, full plot.** A typical plot is ~5 lines: figure, plot call, labels, legend. If something common takes more, the API is wrong.
2. **Deferred rendering.** `plot()`, `xlabel()`, `legend()` only *record* what to draw. `show()` does the actual rendering. This lets the framework compute correct axis limits, lay out legends, and compose new plot types with everything else for free.
3. **matplotlib parity — API and visuals.** Method names, `"C0"`–`"C9"` color shortcuts, `"--"` `":"` linestyle codes, `"o"` `"s"` `"^"` markers all mirror pyplot. Black 0.8 px spines, outward 3.5 px ticks on the bottom + left only (matching matplotlib's actual rcParams: `xtick.direction=out`, `xtick.top=False`, `ytick.right=False`), tab10 cycle, DejaVu Sans, optional dashed grid all mirror matplotlib's default look. If a user knows pyplot, they should be able to guess the call and recognize the output. Top / right ticks are opt-in via `xticks(top=True)` / `yticks(right=True)`.
4. **Static and reproducible.** No interactivity, no animation, no zoom. Same script → byte-identical SVG → visually identical rendering on every machine. This is what unlocks publication-quality output and baseline-image testing.
5. **Custom plot types are first-class — but they live in user projects.** Adding a new artist is ~50–100 lines following the documented recipe. The core stays small specifically to make this easy. Reference implementations go in [`cookbook/`](cookbook/), not the core.

### Running tests / notebooks

Install editable into a Python 3.10+ environment, then run the test scripts:
```bash
pip install -e .
python tests/test_chart.py            # check vs. committed baselines (default)
python tests/test_chart.py --update   # regenerate after intentional visual changes
python tests/test_chart.py --gallery  # build tests/baseline_images/chart/index.html
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/01_basics.ipynb --output /tmp/out.ipynb
```

The test runner plumbing lives in `tests/_runner.py`. Machine-specific interpreter paths and env quirks live in `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored).

### The deferred-rendering pattern (the heart of the library)

Every artist method records a tuple `(name, args, kwargs)` into `Chart._calls`. A name is recordable if it's a frame-state method (`title`, `xlim`, …) or a registered artist:

```python
def __getattr__(self, name):
    if name in _FRAME_METHODS or get_artist(name) is not None:
        def recorder(*args, **kwargs):
            self._calls.append((name, list(args), dict(kwargs)))
            return self
        return recorder
```

Then `to_svg()` does five phases:

1. **Replay** — walks `_calls` to build a state dict (`artists`, `title`, `xlim`, …). Each artist call goes through its registered `spec.record(args, kwargs)`.
2. **Domain compute** — `_scan_domain` walks the artists and calls each one's `spec.xdomain(a)` / `spec.ydomain(a)` to gather autoscale values. Each axis first asks `_is_categorical_axis`: if any artist's `xdomain`/`ydomain` returns a string, the axis is categorical and we collect alphabetical unique values via `_collect_categories` instead of a numeric scan. Two remaining wrinkles: hist pre-binning, and `force_zero` for hist/bar so numeric y anchors at zero.
3. **Scale build** — `_LinearScale`, `_LogScale`, `_CategoryScale`. The category scale fires whenever the axis is categorical (auto-detected from string data, or via explicit `xscale="category"` / `yscale="category"`); `order=[...]` picks an explicit layout, alphabetical otherwise. Ticks come from the standard 1/2/5 × 10ⁿ "nice numbers" algorithm.
4. **Render artists** — three layers (`background` → `data` → `foreground`); each artist's `spec.draw(a, ctx)` emits SVG. `RenderContext` carries the scales, dimensions, color, and defaults.
5. **Frame, ticks, labels, legend** — spines, tick lines, text-as-paths labels, then the in-frame legend box (today's `chart.legend()` overlay). Tick rendering honors the matplotlib-style `xticks(positions, labels, *, rotation, fontsize, direction, marks)` / `yticks(...)` overrides — `[]` hides, `marks=False` keeps labels but skips the lines, `direction="out"|"inout"` flips the inward default. Custom artists can supply `spec.legend_swatch` (discrete entries) and/or `spec.legend_gradient` (continuous color mapping → gradient strip in the layout-level legend). Layout-level multi-panel rendering in `layout.py` does a separate two-pass walk (data leaves first to assign `_color`, then legend leaves harvest those colors), with `legend.py` owning the legend renderer.

### AI-readable SVG attributes (0.3.0)

Every plotlet SVG carries `data-plotlet-*` attributes describing plot type, axes, scales, ranges, and series labels. The root `<svg>` gets `data-plotlet-version` / `-schema` / `-kind`, each panel `<g>` gets title / xlabel / ylabel / xscale / yscale / xlim / ylim / panel-bbox / data-area (where `panel-bbox` is the full-rect figure-coords placement and `data-area` is the data region in panel-local coords), each artist `<g class="plotlet-artist">` gets type / index / label / color plus type-specific extras (n, x-min/max, marker, …). Categorical axes emit a child `<metadata data-plotlet-payload="xcategories">` JSON blob with the labels. The schema (`data-plotlet-schema="1"`) is semver-stable from 0.3.0 forward — additive changes only. Custom artists hook in by declaring an optional `data_attrs=` callback on their `ArtistSpec` for type-specific attrs; common attrs (type, index, label, color) come automatically. Full schema reference: [docs/AI_ATTRS.md](docs/AI_ATTRS.md). The schema's value-added is concrete: [`pt.layout_diagram`](src/plotlet/layout_diagram.py) is a debug visualizer that imports nothing private — it only reads `data-plotlet-*` — so it doubles as a worked example of what a schema consumer looks like.

### Adding a new plot type

The three-step recipe (`record`, `xdomain`/`ydomain`, `draw`, all bundled in an `ArtistSpec` and handed to `add_artist(...)`) is plotlet's central hackability claim — no edits to `core.py`, no monkey-patching. **For most custom plots, the right home is your own project (or [`cookbook/`](cookbook/)) — not the core.** Full guide: [docs/EXTENDING.md](docs/EXTENDING.md); worked recipe: [`cookbook/lollipop/lollipop.py`](cookbook/lollipop/lollipop.py).

### Text rendering — text-as-paths via fontTools

Instead of emitting `<text>` elements that depend on the consumer's installed fonts, plotlet extracts glyph outlines from the bundled DejaVu Sans (`fonts/DejaVuSans.ttf`) and emits `<path d="…">` elements. This unlocks:

- **Cross-machine reproducibility.** Same SVG renders identically on Linux, macOS, Windows, headless CI.
- **Exact text measurement.** `_measure_text(s, size)` returns the precise pixel width by summing glyph advances. The legend box auto-sizes to fit; no `len(text) * 6.2` magic numbers.
- **Self-contained output.** SVG files don't need fonts on the recipient's machine.

Tradeoff: text in the output isn't selectable / searchable. matplotlib makes the same trade for the same reason.

### Visual spec (`spec.json`)

All visual constants — colors, font sizes, spine widths, default alphas, legend dimensions — live in `src/plotlet/spec.json`. The package reads it at import via `_spec.py`. Changing a value in `spec.json` is the *only* way to alter the locked visual style. Don't reintroduce hard-coded literals in render code.

### State on a leaf Chart

Each leaf `Chart` accumulates:

- `_calls` — list of recorded artist + styling calls
- `_data_width`, `_data_height`, `_canvas_width`, `_canvas_height`, `_margin`, `_canvas_explicit` — figure dimensions. The user-facing primitive is the *data region* (`data_width=` / `data_height=`); canvas is derived from data + margin. The legacy canvas-first form (`canvas_width=` / `canvas_height=`) sets `_canvas_explicit=True` and triggers margin scaling at render time. The two are mutually exclusive.

Parent Charts (composed via `|`, `/`, `pt.grid`) carry no leaf state — they only hold `_children` and `_layout_kind`. Their dimensions emerge at render time from summing their children plus gaps.

The replay function (`core._replay(calls)`) reconstructs `title`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `xlim`, `ylim`, `xscale`, `yscale`, `grid`, `legend`, `artists` from `_calls` each render. Stateless rendering = same output every time. For body-first leaves, `core._effective_margin(leaf, st)` combines the floor-applied user margin with `_required_margin(st, dw, dh)` (measured from actual title / axis labels / tick labels) so the canvas grows to fit content rather than letting it overflow.

## Conventions for collaboration

**Dependencies.** plotlet depends on Python 3.10+ and `fonttools` (parses the bundled DejaVu Sans). numpy / pandas / polars inputs are accepted because `_to_pylist` calls `.tolist()` defensively, but the implementation doesn't currently need them. Add deps when they earn their keep — don't avoid them on principle.

When suggesting changes or adding features:

- **Decide core vs cookbook first.** Cookbook is the default for new plot types; core is only for shared infrastructure (this is how `imshow` got in — it carries the colormap registry and the PNG encoder, both reusable) or genuine essentials.
- **Refuse new core plot types by default.** "Let's add a Sankey to the core" is almost always wrong; the right answer is `cookbook/<name>.py` or the user's own project.
- **Lean flexible on existing core artists.** Once an artist is in core, prefer adding kwargs (alpha, color, per-side spine styling, etc.) over telling users to work around their absence. Cost test: how many lines of user code does the result take, with vs. without lib support? If it's ~1 line vs. 20+ lines of fragile workaround (post-processing SVG, monkey-patching globals, drawing parallel artists with the built-in turned off), add the kwarg. Exception: if the customization would noticeably bloat a core artist *and* the user could equivalently implement it as a small cookbook artist, leave it for cookbook. The "refuse new core plot types" rule above keeps the *vocabulary* small; this rule keeps the existing vocabulary friendly.
- **Match existing code style.** Plain Python, top-to-bottom readable, no clever metaclasses or classes-everywhere.
- **Preserve matplotlib API parity** for standard plots. If matplotlib calls it `axhline`, don't call it `horizontalLine`.
- **No premature abstraction.** Three is the threshold — leave duplicated code alone until there's a third use site.
- **Visual constants live in `spec.json`.** If you find yourself typing a number into render code, ask whether it should be there instead.
- **Test with baselines.** Core changes get added to `tests/test_chart.py` with a committed SVG; cookbook examples are reference, not regression-tested.
- **Mention matplotlib quirks that aren't replicated** and why, when relevant.
- **Layout / multi-panel code lives in its own module** (`layout.py` for rect computation + multi-panel assembly; `legend.py` for the layout-level legend), not in `core.py`. Keep responsibilities split: leaf rendering in `core.py` / `artists.py` / `registry.py` / `scales.py`; composition + multi-panel in `layout.py` / `legend.py`.

The actual mechanics of adding an artist (`ArtistSpec`, `add_artist`, `RenderContext`) are in [docs/EXTENDING.md](docs/EXTENDING.md).

## Non-goals

User-facing non-goals (no interactivity, no 3D, no production dashboard, not a matplotlib competitor for standard plots) are listed in [README.md](README.md). Contributor-only reminders:

- **Interactivity is out forever, not deferred.** Hover, zoom, pan, click, animation are *not* "maybe later" — they kill the byte-identical reproducibility that makes baseline-image testing possible. Don't soften this in code review.
- **Not aiming for 100% matplotlib coverage.** Just the parts the author actually uses, plus whatever shared infrastructure is forced by core artists. Reject "we should add this for parity" arguments.

## Long-term direction (collaborator-internal)

Where plotlet is heading once subplots and coordinated multi-panel land: **a lightweight, reproducibility-first alternative for library authors and scientists who don't need 1,000 plot types**, with a specific foothold in the annotated-heatmap niche currently held by ComplexHeatmap (R, aging) and marsilea (Python, heavy + opinionated).

Subplots is the **essential prerequisite, not just one item among others**. Without it plotlet is toy-shaped — any real workflow produces multiple charts, and "assemble in Inkscape" is not a viable path; it kills the reproducibility pillar. Subplots is table stakes for the lightweight identity itself; coordinated multi-panel is the strategic differentiator on top.

Two pillars:

1. **Reproducibility-first.** Byte-identical SVG with text-as-paths; every output renders identically across machines without a font install dance. matplotlib's SVG drifts subtly across machines; this doesn't.
2. **Annotated-heatmap niche after coordinated panels.** ComplexHeatmap is R-only; marsilea is heavy. A small Python library with a clean composition algebra and parent-level `.share_x()` / `.share_y()` (or `pt.grid([[...]], share_x="col"/"row"/True)`) fills a real gap. Sharing forces aspect-ratio coordination across the share class — anchor (first leaf in reading order) sets the scale, others scale proportionally — and unions data ranges. Sequence: subplots first, then the shared-scale hook, then science-niche standard vocabulary that every heatmap-niche incumbent ships (e.g. dendrogram) as core artists, with full ComplexHeatmap-style annotated-heatmap layouts still in cookbook as compositions of those pieces.

Use this as a razor for gray-area requests:

- **Strengthens the goal** → say yes: shared-scale ergonomics, layout composition, colormap quality, reproducibility guarantees, easier annotated-track recipes in cookbook.
- **Drifts from it** → say no, even if tempting: another standard plot type "for parity," interactivity, animation, dashboarding features, or anything that pushes plotlet toward "generic plotting library."

This positioning is collaborator-internal because the prerequisites (subplots, shared scales) aren't built yet — premature to put it in [README.md](README.md) or [docs/PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md). Promote it to public-facing once subplots lands.
